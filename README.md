### Links

- [Solution URL](https://shalinialisha.github.io/frontendmentor-qr-code/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was a fun first project with web development! I learned a lot more about formatting elements. The biggest thing I learned was centering an element vertically and horizontally. 

### Continued development

For the future, I want to focus on best practices. I also would like to get more comfortable with the concepts behind things like "margin", "border", ect. Super excited to keep building stuff!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Styling Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_images.asp) - Super helpful for learning cool stuff that CSS does in a quick manner. 
- [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) - This is my first time working with CSS, so learning about the box model was really useful and helped me understand the layout of my elements much more.
